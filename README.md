# Simple-Crud
A version Built as a Curso de Web Moderno project. From this, I will raise the level of the application to
a personalized front-end example of a formulary that can do All the basic operations of a database, CRUD,
 so I'll keep this Read.me simplistic for now.


# How to start it

By first, you need to do a `npm start` at the ` Backend` folder so the server can start listening

Then you'll do a `npm start` at the ` Frontend` folder so the react app boot at your browser.

And that's it, you'll have my basic version of a CRUD running in your browser.



# Incomming changes

So, by first, I'll implement Styled Components at everything so this can be easier to stylize.
With this, comes the dark version and some minor changes to the interface design.
Then I want to add more options to the form.

For now, that's all my plans for this Application, so stick around to see those changes soon.
